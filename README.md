# Joins-and-Unions

This project demonstrates various SQL operations on two sample tables: Country and Persons. These operations include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, retrieving distinct country names, listing all country names including duplicates, and rounding numerical ratings. The operations will provide insights into how to query, manipulate, and display data effectively in a relational database.
