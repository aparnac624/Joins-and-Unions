# Joins-and-Unions

This project demonstrates various SQL operations on two sample tables: Country and Persons. These operations include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, retrieving distinct country names, listing all country names including duplicates, and rounding numerical ratings. The operations will provide insights into how to query, manipulate, and display data effectively in a relational database.

Operations Performed :
(1) Perform inner join, Left join, and Right join on the tables. 
(2) List all distinct country names from both the Country and Persons tables. 
(3) List all country names from both the Country and Persons tables, including duplicates. 
(4) Round the ratings of all persons to the nearest integer in the Persons table.

The screenshots of outputs of each question has been attached for reference. Also, the screenshots of tables Country and Persons has been attached.
